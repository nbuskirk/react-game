<h1>React Game Example</h1>

<p>This is an example REACT game. Very basic. 2 Components introduced so far--Game, and GameTile. The level and player is built out of the same tile.</p>

<p>Binds keyboard events from the document level to the localized game function. May need to re-think this? React seems strange with keyPress events...</p>
